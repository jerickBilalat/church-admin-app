# Administration Web Application

Goal: To build an administartion application where users can create events and publish it via email to notify members. 

This project is the culmination of my 3 months and counting, learning the MERN stack from various resources that are listed below. It is **currently in developement.**

Update 02/05/18: The main focus this week are mocking API and error handling.

## Learning Resources

* **Getting MEAN** book by Simon Holmes
* **JavaScript Development Environment** course by Cory House on Pluralsight
* **Building Applicaitons in React and Redux in ES6** course by Cory House on Pluralsight
* **Node with React: Full Stack Development** course by Stephen Grider on Udemy
* **The Complete Node.js Developer Course (2nd Edition)** course by Andrew Mead on Udemy
* **and more**

## Get Started

1. **Install [Node 8 or higher](https://nodejs.org)**.
2. **Clone this repository.**
3. **Make sure you're in the directory you just created.**
4. **Install Node Packages.** - `npm install`
5. **Create a copy of the prod.js file in the config folder and named it dev.js** 
6. **Change object key values in the dev.js file to your Google Auth API keys and MongoURI. The cookieKey value can be random alphanumeric characters**
7. **Run the app.** - `npm run client`

Update 02/06/18: Currently integrating mock API for the client, therefore when running the applicaiton via npm run client, note that it is not the full stack version but only client integrated with the mock APIs.
